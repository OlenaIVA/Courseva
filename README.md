# PET Projects
Hi
My name is Olena. I'm passionate about constantly learning new things and am always eager to explore new opportunities. I love tackling challenging problems and acquiring new skills, whether it's through personal projects, online courses, or diving into technical topics on my own.
In my free time, I enjoy working on a variety of pet projects that allow me to learn and experiment. These range from building small web applications, to analyzing datasets, to exploring new programming languages and frameworks. I find great fulfillment in the creative process of turning an idea into a functional project.
My curiosity and drive to improve myself are key parts of who I am. I'm excited to continue growing, learning, and discovering new passions and interests along the way.
